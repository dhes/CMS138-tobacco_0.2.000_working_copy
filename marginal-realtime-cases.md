A marginal realtime case is one that produces different values for Initial Population (and the resulting denominators) between the realtime case (year from start of Measurement Period = 1900) vs the retrospective case (year from start of Measurement Period = current year). Here is a list of those cases present in the MADiE 2026 Tobacco test cases.
